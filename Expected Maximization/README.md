Two biased coins C1 and C2. N = total number of trials the coins are tossed. 
P is the probability C1 will be selected, if C1 is selected C1 is tossed. Probability of getting head using C1 is P1
with probability (1-P) C2 is selected, if C2 is selected , C2 is tossed with probability of head P2.
Expectation Maximization algorithm predicts the probability P'', P1'', P2'' given some initialization value P', P1',P2'
Here we have taken initialization values as same as actual values i.e P=P', P1=P1', P2=P2'
