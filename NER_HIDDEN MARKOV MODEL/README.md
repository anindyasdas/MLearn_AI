Named-entity recognition (NER) seeks to locate and classify named entities in text
into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations
etc.
Design a named entity recognition system for Twitter that identifies the presence of
named entities in a tweet.
Input: A tokenized sentence.
Output: NER tags for each token of the sentence.
Setups:
1. Identify all the named entity, i.e., whether a token is a named entity or not.
2. First identify all the named entity and then find the types of each name entity.
3. Identify the named entity types in one step.
Approach: Solve the problem of NER through following approaches and compare
their performances.
‚óè Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
HMM implementation from scratch. Calculate emission and transition probabilities and use Viterbi
to get the NER sequence.
